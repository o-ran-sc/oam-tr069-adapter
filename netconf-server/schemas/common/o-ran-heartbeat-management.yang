      "PLEASE READ BELOW NOTES BEFORE USING THE MODEL:
       1)  All attributes of TR 196, 181 and OneCell extensions are all covered
           in this same YANG File. In future this shall split into three
           different yang models.

       2) The reason for using single file is that the SDN-R Configuration APP
          doesn't load the UI properly if the yang model uses augmentations.
          Once the SDN-R Configuration App supports augmented yang files then
          the model could be split into different files.

       3) For tabular parameters, in yang model 'index' is used as a key and it
          is introduced to indicate the row id/index value in table. ";
